# Bubble-sort
Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string of numbers or other elements in the correct order. 
In Bubble sort in C, we compare two adjacent elements of an array to find which one is greater or lesser and swap them based on the given condition, 
whether ascending or descending, until the final place of the element is not found.
We repeat this until no more swaps are required, and all the elements get sorted.
